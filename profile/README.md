# MRI Lab Graz - BIDS Tools

Welcome to the GitHub organization of **MRI Lab Graz**! Here, we provide open-source tools and pipelines to facilitate the use of the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format in neuroimaging research. Our tools are designed to streamline data conversion, organization, analysis, and sharing. Below, you'll find an overview of the repositories and their functionalities.
